===========================================================================
This is a series of bash scripts/commands to be used to perform basic
utilities for a GeoNode instance. This has several case scenarios which
include:
       *Backing up a geonode to a directory- $geonode-backup [origin] [destinati        on]
       *Restoring a geonode from a backup- $geonode-backup /data/geonode-backup/geonode_backup2011Nov4
       *Setting up a mirror by providing two datails the localserver and the remote address of the mirror server $geonode-backup localhost geonode@demo.geonode.org
Hopefully in future we will look into backing up to an S3 service.
While backing up time stamps will be attached and GWC files will not be 
zipped,this is just cleaning and addition of more properties to the following script https://gist.github.com/1318669
========================================================================
To perform a back up/restore to a directory run the following command syntax
geonode-backup account@serverip directory operation
For example:
geonode-backup geonode@horn.rcmrd.org data --backup
geonode-backup geonode@horn.rcmrd.org data/geonode_2011_06_01/ --restore

To perform a mirror
geonode-backup source destination operation
For example:
geonode-backup geonode@horn.rcmrd.org ubuntu@localhost --mirror

Notes: 
I tried to run the gnmedia within the scipt with little success,on the destination you may have to run gnmedia for the ui changes to reflect. You will also need to change the local_settings file with what you had before...am thinking the token is important here.
At the moment i do not think it does the mirroring it the destination is at another IP address. IE it has to be done on the destination computer for now.
Feel free to provide feedback. Feeling that methods could make the code less. Confirmed the tests, the database mirror each other same with geoserver. One may have to run gnmedia after.

IMPORTANT
This does not yet do restore and backup to a remote destination i.e external server or amazon instance. Alot of the code could be reused using functions
